# Tic Tac Toe

> This project was the first that I implemented. It is under the category "easy" but it teaches you a lot about python, especially if you are a beginner.From the HyperSkill academy: ``` Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing! After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.```

## Example

```python
# You just insert the coordinates. The X starts always first. The coordinates must be at this format: 1 1, 1 2. With the 1 1 being the cell at the left bottom corner.
---
```

### Setup

- You dont need anything special to run this script.


## Features

The script provides the normal features of a tic tac toe game:
- 2 players can play 
- The script understands if a cell is occupied and provides the appropriate message.
- The script terminates the game when a winner is found and displays a message.
- Also it can find out if there is a draw (typicall outcome of this game).

## FAQ

- **How can 2 people play this game?**
    - You can upload the script to an online python compiles like "replit" and invite your friend or you can play it from one PC.
    
- **How many variables do I have to input?**
    - You must input everytime the coordinates of the cell you are willing to put a symbol. 1 1 is the cell at the left bottom corner.
