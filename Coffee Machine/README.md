# Coffee Machine

> Projects that simulate how real world machines work are the best opportunity for someone to learn how to code efficiently. This project is about the implementation of a coffee machine program. You can choose to buy a coffee (3 options), to fill the machine with ingredients and to take the money of it (yes I know, its not safe now.Anyone can take the money at this point). 
From HyperSkill academy : ```What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money. This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python. ```

## Below is an example of the script's usage.

- TO BE ADDED

## Example

```python
# There is handy menu asking about your inputs. You just type in the number/word of your desired input!
---
```

### Setup

- You dont need anything special to run this script.


## Features

The coffee machine has the following features:
- It has a menu that asks you the following:
    - Buy coffee / Fill the machine with ingredients / Take the money / See the remaining ingredients / exit the menu.
- If you select the buy feature it shows 3 different options of coffee: Espresso / Latte / cappuccino.
- If the machine has enough ingredients it makes you a coffee, if not it displays a message about the missing ingredient.
- You can fill the machine with the ingredients of your desire. It shows you a message about the amount that you want to fill.
- You can take the money that is stored inside the machine (it starts with 500$).

## FAQ

- **How is the script implemented?**
    - At this project hyperskill encourages you to start working with classes. We implemented a class "Coffee_machine" with which you can create objects (many coffee machines).
    
- **How can you secure that nobody else takes the money?**
    - Right now the program doesnt take care of it. In the future we can add a pin code and username while creating the coffee machine object, and it will ask for them when you select the "take" feature.
    
 - **Can you store infinite ingredients in the machine?**
    - Currently yes. There is no upper limit but it can be added easily.
