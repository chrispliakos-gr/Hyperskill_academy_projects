# Hangman Game

> This project is about a very simple and classic game, the hangman! It is one of the best project for beginners and one of the funniest to code. From HyperSkill Academy: ```Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!
Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.```

## Below is an example of the script's usage.

## Example

```python
# You can just run the script and start guessing the correct word.
---
```

### Setup

- You need to import the "random" module. (Included in the code)
- You need to modify/add words at the word list!


## Features

The script has the following features:
- Provides a flexible word list that you can easily modify and add/remove words.
- It gives you the opportunity to guess 8 times before you are hanged! (You can modify that also).
- Displays the appropriate errors whenever you guess a wrong letter.
- It doesnt allow you to guess a wrong/same letter a second time.

## FAQ

- **How many words can I import??**
    - Theoretically, infinite words can be fitted in the word list. A wise choice could be to use a word dictionary and import words from there.
    
- **How many letters can I guess before I get hanged?**
    - You can guess 8 wrong different letters.

- **How can I hide the word list from the code?**
	- You can make a second .py script with the word list only and import it in the main script.
	- You can make the script run with sys arguments from a command prompt and avoid any interraction between player and python script.
