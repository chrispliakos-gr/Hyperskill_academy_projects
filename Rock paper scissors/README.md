```

### Setup

- You need to import the "random" module. (Included in the code)

## Features

The script has the following features:
- Asks the user about his name and provides a greeting message.
- The game asks the user if he wants to make his own game. You can leave it blank and you will play the classic version, else you can add some of these option:
	- ["fire", "rock", "gun", "lightning", "devil", "dragon", "water", "air", "paper",
                   "sponge", "wolf", "tree", "human", "snake", "scissors"]
- The script creates a file with the score every time you play the game. It stores the score and you can ask for your rating.
- Possible commands !exit for exit and !rating for your rating.
- The algorithm splits the game list (all possible options) into 2 halves, one after the user selection and one before his selection. The options after, beat the user.

## FAQ

- **How is the score calculated???**
    - Draw is 50 points, Win is 100 points and you dont lose points at loses.
